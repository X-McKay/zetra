# Agent Runtime Platform

`platform/` implements the Agent Runtime Platform specification (revision 2):
Kata sandboxes reachable only through agentgateway, OAuth agent identity from a
projected ServiceAccount token, the Agent Policy Service as fail-closed external
authorization, and a Session Runner that drives one boundary per kubelet exec.
It is built alongside the OpenShell runtime in `src/zetra`; that path stays
supported until the platform's Phase B conformance tests pass on a cluster.

| Directory | Spec section | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform/contracts` | 3, 5.2, 5.3, 6.3 | `agent_platform` constants and naming, policy bundle and digest, pod template, tenant NetworkPolicy set and digest, `agentctl` |
| `../deploy/platform/crds` | 6.1, 6.2 | `Agent` and `AgentRelease` CRDs (vendored by Kubani) |
| `platform/controller` | 6.4, 7.3, 7.4 | Registry Controller (kopf) with a Keycloak admin adapter |
| `platform/netpol-attestor` | 5.5 | node DaemonSet recording host-side kube-router chains on sandbox pods |
| `platform/egress-guard` | 5.5 | sandbox init container; `--attack` mode for T2b |
| `platform/agent-runtime` | 11 | `agent_runtime` sandbox SDK baked into agent images |
| `platform/aps` | 9 | Agent Policy Service (Go): ext_authz, token and grants API, Redis ledger and vault, settlement |
| `platform/runner` | 10 | Session Runner, cleanup reconciler, AES-GCM payload codec |

Each directory is its own project with its own lock. `just platform-check` runs
every project's lint and tests; tests that need a cluster are marked `cluster`
and are named after the conformance test they cover. Nothing here has run on a
cluster yet; the items in spec 17.3 must be confirmed there before Phase A is
accepted. Deployment manifests live in Kubani.
